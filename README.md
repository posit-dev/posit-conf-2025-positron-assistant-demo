## üêç Python demo

### Step 1: Run the script in the Console

1. Open up [the Python script](./python-demo.py) in an editor

1. Run the script by clicking the **Play** button in the Editor Actions bar

   - Once all the code has been run, you should see:

        - code executed in the Console

        - data loaded into the Variables pane

        - a plot rendered in the Plots pane

### Step 2: Explore the data with Positron Assistant

1. Open the Positron Assistant pane by clicking on the Positron Assistant robot icon in the sidebar, or by opening the Command Palette (<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd>) and running the [command "View: Show Chat"](command:workbench.panel.chat).

1. In the Positron Assistant pane, ensure your chat is in `Ask` mode. You can switch modes by clicking on the mode selector at the bottom of the chat pane.

1. Use the example messages below to explore the Georgia Aquarium Species dataset.

#### Example prompts

Try out these example prompts in `Ask` mode!

```
What region has the most animals with the highest conservation risk?
```

```
Extract the species size in inches.
```

```
Extract the animal's primary color from their physical characteristics.
```

```
Categorize the different types of habitats and then count the number of species in each habitat type.
```

### Step 3: Export the chat into a Quarto document

1. In the Positron Assistant chat in `Ask` mode, enter `/exportQuarto` and send the message.

1. Positron Assistant will generate a Quarto document based on the chat history, including code chunks and explanations.

1. Save the generated Quarto document as `report.qmd` in your project directory.

You're done! üéâ

### Step 4: [OPTIONAL] Explore more with `Agent` mode

<details>
<summary>Additional prompts for `Agent` mode</summary>

`Agent` mode allows Positron Assistant to modify and run code in the Console, making it possible to perform more complex tasks.

#### Additional prompts for `Agent` mode

1. Start a new chat by clicking on the "+" icon at the top of the Positron Assistant sidebar chat.

1. Switch to `Agent` mode by clicking on the mode selector at the bottom of the chat pane and selecting `Agent`.

1. Ensure you have the [demo script](./python-demo.py) attached to the chat context. If it is not already attached:

    1. Open the file in the editor

    1. Drag the file tab to the sidebar chat; or in the Command Palette (<kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd>), run the [command "Chat: Add File to Chat"](command:workbench.action.chat.attachFile).

1. Then, try these additional prompts:

    ```
    Update the script to change the colour scheme to oceanic colours.
    ```

    - Run the script to see the changes reflected in the plot. If you're satisfied with the changes, you can "Keep" the changes.

    ```
    Create a heatmap of the conservation risk by region.
    ```

    - Positron Assistant may prompt you to "Run Code" to better understand the data and execute code in the Console. Click "Run Code" to execute the code in the Console.
