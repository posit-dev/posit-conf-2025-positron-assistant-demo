African Penguin,https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/animal/african-penguin/,https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/african-penguin-2-250x250.jpg,Spheniscus demersus,Critically Endangered,18-25 inches (46-64 cm) tall,"Fishes, crustaceans, squid",Southernmost coast of Africa,Temperate climates near water,"The adult African penguin stands 18 to 25 inches (46-64 cm) tall and weighs 6 to 7 lbs. (2.7 – 3.2 kg). Black back and a white breast. The chest and belly may also have black markings. The white color extends in a semicircular pattern behind and over the head. A horseshoe-shaped black stripe extends across the chest and flanks. Bare flesh-pink skin surrounds the eyes. Juvenile feathers are shades of grey with a lighter belly and chest. They maintain their juvenile feathers for one year post-fledging when they molt to their adult plumage. Both sexes look the same, which means they are not sexually dimorphic. Penguin feathers are stiff and overlap in layers to trap air next to the skin for insulation. The feathers are very resistant to wind and water. The birds waterproof themselves by using their beak to spread oil from a gland at the base of the tail. African penguins are often seen preening each other (allopreening). Allopreening helps birds preen clean and arrange feathers in areas they cannot reach, such as their neck. Allopreening plays a role in strengthening bonds between mates. Before their yearly molt, penguins feed avidly, putting on extra weight in the form of fat. Molting generally takes place during the summer months. It can also be common to see some birds molt outside of these seasons. The molting process is stressful because these birds lose their thermal protection and are unable to hunt for food or swim. Molting takes approximately two weeks. They fast during this time, lose weight, and become listless. It takes another four to ten days for new feathers to grow in and become waterproof. Only then can the penguin return to the sea to feed. The bones of penguins are solid, unlike the hollow bones of flying birds, to increase body weight and provide ballast when diving. The solid bones of the penguin make the bird too heavy to fly. The wings of this flightless bird are modified flippers for swimming. The wing bones are flattened and broadened to take the thrust of water. The surface of the wings is covered with scale-like feathers.","African penguins molt once a year. During this time, they lose all of their feathers and grow a new set."

Females reach lengths of about 10 feet (3 m). The tail is about one-half the body length. Characteristically broad snout. The upper jaw is wider than the lower jaw and completely overlaps it so that the edge of the upper jaw overlaps teeth in the lower jaw. Bottom teeth are almost completely hidden when the mouth is closed. This is in contrast to crocodiles, in which the lower teeth are visible outside of the upper jaw. Juveniles are darker in color with bright yellow cross-bands. Aging brings the gradual loss of the banding and the alligator will turn olive brown and black, with some areas around the jaws and neck a creamy white. The ventral surface of the body is pale. Adults usually have 74-80 teeth. New teeth grow to replace lost or damaged ones. Small, sensory pits dotted around the upper and lower jaws can detect small pressure changes in water and assist in locating and capturing prey.","The sex of alligator hatchlings is determined by the temperature of the nest during incubation. Warmer temperatures produce males, while cooler temperatures produce females."

This adaptation allows for maneuverability in shallow water to hunt and to escape from predators. Very thick layer of blubber, thick skin, relatively small tail flukes and pectoral flippers, and absence of a dorsal fin are adaptations for life in cold water. The melon is the rounded structure on the top of the beluga’s head, just in front of the blowhole. It is composed of lipids (fats) and can change shape when the whale is producing sounds. The melon focuses and projects echolocation signals through the water. It is unique to toothed whales and not found on baleen whales. Lips can be pursed to form the shape of an “O.” Tongue forms a tight seal around fish which allows the beluga to swallow prey without ingesting water. Rather than a dorsal fin, which would be prone to injury from ice and heat loss, a beluga has a dorsal ridge. Generally pale gray to pure white as adults, belugas are a light gray color at birth. Their light coloration is believed to camouflage the animal in snowy, icy surroundings. Areas such as the dorsal ridge, the edges of the pectoral flippers and the edges of the tail flukes may be darker on adult belugas. Average weight and length of an adult ranges between 1100-2500 lbs (499-1143 kg) and 11-15 feet (3.4-4.6 m). Average calf birth weight is 119-145 lbs (54-66 kg) and length is 4.5-5.1 feet (137-155 cm). The maximum adult weight reported is 3600 lbs (1633 kg). Belugas show sexual dimorphism, with males being approximately 25% larger than females. The beluga whale has 30-40 homodont (of similar size and shape), conical teeth. Teeth are not replaced if lost. A calf’s teeth begin to come in between 1 and 2 years of age. The teeth of Odontocetes contain growth rings, called “Growth Layer Groups” (GLG).",Belugas are sometimes called “sea canaries” due to the extensive variety of sounds they can make!

The average length is between 18 and 32 feet (5.5-9.8 m). Newborns measure 21 to 25 inches (53-64 cm) long. Whale sharks have a broad, flat head, relatively small eyes, five large gill slits, two dorsal fins, two long pectoral fins, two pelvic fins, one anal fin and a large sweeping tail. It has a vestigial spiracle behind the eye, which is an evolutionary remnant of its common ancestry with bottom-dwelling (benthic) carpet sharks. Unlike most shark species, its mouth is located at the front of the head (terminal) instead of the underside of the rostrum (subterminal). The whale shark has a huge mouth, which can reach up to 4 feet (1.2 m) across, located at the front of the head. Inside the mouth are specialized flaps called velums. These stop the backflow of water as the whale shark closes its mouth, preventing the loss of food. The skin of an adult whale shark can be as thick as 4 inches (10 cm) and has the consistency of strong rubber, which limits possible predators to killer whales, great white sharks, tiger sharks and humans. Whale sharks have a two-toned pattern of light spots on their dark gray back with a white underside. Each whale shark has its own individual spot pattern; like human fingerprints, no two are exactly alike.

Known as hexacorals, they have tentacles in multiples of 6 (6, 12, 24). Nematocysts (stinging cells) in tentacles release an often-fatal toxin into prey or threats. The polyp provides shelter for zooxanthellae (single-celled algae) The yellow to brown color of this coral is attributed to the zooxanthellae living with the polyp. Other colors are attributed to UV protecting and light regulating proteins. Hard exoskeleton made of calcium carbonate. Skeleton cup (calyx) created as lower portion of the polyp secretes calcium carbonate. When a polyp dies, other polyps build on top of it and continue to secrete calcium carbonate which, over time, creates a larger coral reef. Polyps will generally contract into its calyx when stressed and extend when feeding. Identical coral polyps next to each other form a structure and pattern. There are many types of hard coral, which are often categorized based on appearance:Branching(primary and secondary branches)Digitate(finger-like with no secondary branches)Table(table-like)Elkhorni(large, flattened branches)Foliase(plate-like with whorl patterns)Encrusting(thin layer against substrate)Massive/Boulder(ball-shaped ranging from very small to very large)Mushroom(resembles a mushroom top) Branching(primary and secondary branches) Digitate(finger-like with no secondary branches) Table(table-like) Elkhorni(large, flattened branches) Foliase(plate-like with whorl patterns) Encrusting(thin layer against substrate) Massive/Boulder(ball-shaped ranging from very small to very large) Mushroom(resembles a mushroom top)",Aquarists at Georgia Aquarium propagate and cultivate coral in an aquaculture system; the coral is then transplanted to the Aquarium's live reef wall located in Tropical Diver.

Webbed hind feet that can be spread wide like flippers are well adapted for swimming. Forepaws are smaller with retractable claws and are used to groom, eat, and hold tools for breaking open prey. Classified as a marine “fissiped”, the sea otter is an aquatic carnivore that is well-adapted for its life at sea. The digits on its front paws are separated and covered, similar to mittens. Its claws are retractable and the front paws have rough pads. These features help sea otters more easily grasp their slippery or spiny prey. On the hind paws, the pads are reduced and may be absent, except on the toes. The fifth digit or little toe is longer than all other otters, allowing the sea otter to spread its webbing wider when swimming. The majority of the southern sea otter’s teeth are flattened molars for crushing and chewing shelled, invertebrate prey. The otter has a set of canine teeth as well. Major tooth wear is a cause of mortality in older otters. Webbed hind feet that can be spread wide like flippers are well adapted for swimming. The sea otter’s body is covered in dense fur that constantly must be groomed to maintain its insulating properties and cleanliness; therefore, a sea otter will spend a large amount of time grooming. This thick coat helps to maintain its body temperature in cold ocean water. The fur of the sea otter is the densest of all mammals at about 350,000 to 1,000,000 hairs per square inch, compared to dogs which only have 1,000 to 60,000 hairs per square inch. The sea otter’s fur also is designed to trap air to further insulate it from the cold water and to provide additional buoyancy.","Southern sea otters can store food in ""pockets"" under their foreleg."

The whale shark has a huge mouth, which can reach up to 4 feet (1.2 m) across, located at the front of the head. Inside the mouth are specialized flaps called velums. These stop the backflow of water as the whale shark closes its mouth, preventing the loss of food. The skin of an adult whale shark can be as thick as 4 inches (10 cm) and has the consistency of strong rubber, which limits possible predators to killer whales, great white sharks, tiger sharks and humans. Whale sharks have a two-toned pattern of light spots on their dark gray back with a white underside. Each whale shark has its own individual spot pattern; like human fingerprints, no two are exactly alike. The teeth of the whale shark are tiny and pointed backward; they are thought to have no function in feeding. There are about 300 rows of tiny teeth along the inner surface of each jaw, just inside the mouth.",The whale shark is the biggest fish in the sea.
